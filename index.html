<h4> HTML Introduction </h4>
<p> HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages. </p>
<h4> What is HTML?</h4>
<p>
*HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language <br>
*HTML describes the structure of a Web page<br>
*HTML consists of a series of elements <br>
*HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content <br>
*HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc. <br>

<h4> CSS Introduction </h4>
<p> CSS is the language we use to style a Web page. </p>
<h4> What is CSS? </h4>
<p>
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets <br>
CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media <br>
CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once <br>
External stylesheets are stored in CSS files <br>

<h4> Python Introduction </h4>
<h4> What is Python? </h4>
<p>
Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.<br>

It is used for: <br>

web development (server-side),<br>
software development,<br>
mathematics,<br>
system scripting.<br>
</p>
<h4> What Can Python do? </h4>
<p>
*Python can be used on a server to create web applications.<br>
*Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.<br>
*Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.<br>
*Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.<br>
*Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.<br>
</p>
<h4> Why Phython </h4>
<p>
*Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).<br>
*Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.<br>
*Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.<br>
*Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.<br>
*Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.<br>
</p>
<h4> Good to Know </h4>
<p>
*The most recent major version of Python is Python 3, which we shall be using in this tutorial. However, Python 2, although not being updated with anything other than security updates, is still quite popular.<br>
*In this tutorial Python will be written in a text editor. It is possible to write Python in an Integrated Development Environment, such as Thonny, Pycharm, Netbeans or Eclipse which are particularly useful when managing larger collections of Python files.<br>
</p>
<h4> Python Syntex compared to other programming languages </h4>
<p>
*Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.<br>
*Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.<br>
*Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.<br>

<h4> What is Javascript? </h4>
<p>
Welcome to the MDN beginner's JavaScript course! In this article we will look at JavaScript from a high level, answering questions such as "What is it?" and "What can you do with it?", and making sure you are comfortable with JavaScript's purpose.
</p>
<h4> So what can it really do?</h4>
<p>
The core client-side JavaScript language consists of some common programming features that allow you to do things like:<br> <br>
*Store useful values inside variables. In the above example for instance, we ask for a new name to be entered then store that name in a variable called name.<br>
*Operations on pieces of text (known as "strings" in programming). In the above example we take the string "Player 1: " and join it to the name variable to create the complete text label, e.g. "Player 1: Chris".<br>
*Running code in response to certain events occurring on a web page. We used a click event in our example above to detect when the label is clicked and then run the code that updates the text label.<br>
*And much more!<br> <br>
What is even more exciting however is the functionality built on top of the client-side JavaScript language. So-called Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) provide you with extra superpowers to use in your JavaScript code.<br>
APIs are ready-made sets of code building blocks that allow a developer to implement programs that would otherwise be hard or impossible to implement. They do the same thing for programming that ready-made furniture kits do for home building — it is much easier to take ready-cut panels and screw them together to make a bookshelf than it is to work out the design yourself, go and find the correct wood, cut all the panels to the right size and shape, find the correct-sized screws, and then put them together to make a bookshelf.

<h4> What is PHP? </h4>
<p>
PHP(short for Hypertext PreProcessor) is the most widely used open source and general purpose server side scripting language used mainly in web development to create dynamic websites and applications. It was developed in 1994 by Rasmus Lerdorf. A survey by W3Tech shows that almost 79% of the websites in their data are developed using PHP. It is not only used to build the web apps of many tech giants like Facebook but is also used to build many CMS (Content Management System) like WordPress, Drupal, Shopify, WooCommerce etc.
</p>
<h4> Why to use PHP? </h4>
<p>
PHP can actually do anything related to server-side scripting or more popularly known as the backend of a website. For example, PHP can receive data from forms, generate dynamic page content, can work with databases, create sessions, send and receive cookies, send emails etc. There are also many hash functions available in PHP to encrypt user’s data that makes PHP secure and reliable to be used as a server-side scripting language. So these are some of the abilities of PHP that makes it suitable to be used as server-side scripting language. You will get to know more of these abilities in further tutorials
</p>
<h4> Why are using it? </h4>
<p>
Big Tech Giants like Facebook, Slack, Lyft etc.<br>
Content Management System like WordPress, Drupal etc.<br>
E-Commerce Platforms like Magento and many more.<br>
</p>
<h4> Advantage </h4>
<p>
*Platform Independent<br>
*Open source and dynamic Library support<br>
*Organized<br>
*Database Connectivity<br>
*Easy to understand and code<br>
*Gives Web Developer More Control<br>
*Easy integration and consistency<br>
*Maintenance<br>
*Stability<br>
*Performance<br>
*Reliability<br>
*Scalability <br>
*Compatibility

<h4> What is Java? </h4>
<p>
Java is a popular programming language, created in 1995.<br> <br>

It is owned by Oracle, and more than 3 billion devices run Java.<br>

It is used for:<br> <br> 

Mobile applications (specially Android apps)<br> 
Desktop applications<br> 
Web applications<br> 
Web servers and application servers<br> 
Games<br> 
Database connection<br> 
And much, much more!
</p>
<h4> Why Use Java? </h4>
<p>
Java works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc.)<br> 
It is one of the most popular programming language in the world<br> 
It has a large demand in the current job market<br> 
It is easy to learn and simple to use<br> 
It is open-source and free<br> 
It is secure, fast and powerful<br> 
It has a huge community support (tens of millions of developers)<br> 
Java is an object oriented language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs<br> 
As Java is close to C++ and C#, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to Java or vice versa
